Note: for privacy and safty consideration, I did not post the YMCA WWI Punch card data on this repository. The data should be available in near future in the data repository of UMN. If you are interested in analyzing the data set, you can go to the [Data Repository for U of M](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/166578).

This is an example of data cleaning from the .json raw form. My work is to extract the data from a single column and then create a number of new columns to store the corresponding data. Also, I need to match the numbers with their text meanings. Since the number of texts are not large, I used brute force there and typed the relationships between the numbers and the texts by hands. This actually could be done by a web scraping script, if the number of features is huge.
